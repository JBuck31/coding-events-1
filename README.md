# coding-events-1
Coding events forked from LaunchCode
Section 1
The purpose of this app is to store and display coding events.

Section 2
Currently the app can be used to add new events. Each event contains a field for Name, Description of event, contact e-mail and category. Event IDs are automatically generated. Events can also be deleted.
You can view a list of all events, all categories, or events just in a certain category.

Section 3
Future improvements would be to add a person class that allows a user to make an account and to sign up for the events through the app.
